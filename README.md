# Fruit-Ninja-FX
A simple clone of fruit ninja done in java.

##### Used Libraries `lib folder`:
* **_Jaxb_** : For xml file parsing.
* **_Javafx_11.0.2_** : Main Library used for creating the GUI.

# Rules
* Always keep a `res` folder for resources that are required during program runtime
* Push any changes with meaningful comments describing the changes 

# Requirements
* [ ] The code folder
* [ ] Self-executable jar file (JRE 1.8): The program should be executable by simply
double clicking the icon or by double clicking on a bash/ batch file .
* [ ] Report should include a thorough description of your design.
* [ ] Report should include a Class Diagram showing main classes in your application.
* [ ] Report should include Sequence Diagrams showing essential or main behaviour
among your classes, showing only necessary and important program flows.
* [ ] Report should include the Design Patterns you used and the intent it is used for
in your application.
* [ ] Report should include snapshots of your GUI.
* [ ] Report should include a user guide that explains how to use your application.
* [ ] Add Readme.txt file with any assumptions you need to run the program, and with
the detailed division of labor among the team members

# Work Division
All team members contributes equivalently to the project. From resources to the creation of the classes and the UML members had their say. 
For communication and file sharing team members made use of the popular Social communication app Discord, whereby joint coding sessions conducted.
Git was mainly used as a form of version control and Project snapshot creation."# FruitNinja"
